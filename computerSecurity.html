          <p style = "font-size: 16px;">Computer/Cyber Security is the protection of computing systems and the data that they store or access. Form a general perspective it may look as something really complicated, how else did the wiki leaks happen? But if you narrow it down, it all begins with you, the user.</p>

          <p style = "font-size: 16px;">How many attacks to computers do you think take place every day? </p>
          <p style = "font-size: 16px;">These unfathomable number of threats that are out there, ready to take charge and destroy vital information, invade our privacy and cause fatal harm are innumerable. Due to these horrendous effects, it is crucial for each and every one of us to be made aware of these threats and how to combat them. Below are some of the major threats that we encounter in our daily lives:</p>
            <ul style = "list-style-type: disc; font-size: 16px; padding-top:10px;">
              <li>Computer viruses – These are the most common and infect multiple files in a computer. They spread to other files when infected files are sent via email.</li>
              <li>Worms – They infect once the use the computer network to spread to other machines. They can send out thousand copies of themselves and basically ‘eat’ a computer software/system.</li>
              <li>Adware – Break it down to ‘ad-ware’. These are the common pop up ads we see that offer free download of software that come in built with other unwanted variants e.g. tracking tools etc. </li>
              <li>Spyware – The name speaks for itself. It spies on what you’re doing, browsing history etc. then sends this information to a third party for other use.</li>
              <li>Ransomware – Again, ransom-ware. It infects your computer then encrypts sensitive data and demands for a ransom to not release that information.</li>
              <li>Trojan horses – These stay hidden in plain sight and once installed it makes changes to the computer to carry out malicious activities without the awareness and consent of the user. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 style="color:#3680C1"><b>How do we protect ourselves from these dangers</b></h3> <br>
        <p style = "font-size: 16px;">Good Security Standards follow the "90 / 10" Rule:</p>
          <ul style = "list-style-type: disc; font-size: 16px; padding-top:10px;">
            <li>10% of security safeguards are technical.</li>
            <li>90% of security safeguards rely on the computer user ("YOU") to adhere to good computing practices</li>
          </ul>
            <br>
            <p style = "font-size: 16px;">Example: The lock on the car is the 10%. You remembering to lock the lock, checking to see if the car doors are closed, ensuring others do not prop the door open, keeping control of the keys, etc. is the 90%. You need both parts for effective security.</p>
            <p style = "font-size: 16px;">In a nutshell, learn good computing security practises.</p>
            <br>
            <p style = "font-size: 16px;">Good computing practices all comes down to one thing; i.e. – you the user acting out and employing the necessary measures to safeguard your information. These good practises include:</p>
          <ul style = "list-style-type: disc; font-size: 16px; clear:both; padding-top:10px">
            <li>Passwords – Confidential data, such as passwords, are a key target of cybercriminals. It serves the key path to hack into accounts which is why it is so important to use a unique, complex password for each online account. A good character is always one that has 15 characters or more, made up of letters, numbers and special characters. This way, if one account is compromised, cybercriminals don't get access to all your online accounts. Even security questions may not act as an effective barrier, because many people give the same answer: If the question is "What's your favourite food?" and you're in the United States, "Pizza" is a common answer.</li>
            <li>Antivirus –> It is vital to invest in an antivirus software. Make sure your computer is protected with up-to-date antivirus and anti-spyware software to detect and neutralise threats before they take over your computer and cause it to collapse. A virus is the easiest method to take over a person’s computer however this can be countered upon by the use of an antivirus software.</li>
            <li>Anti-malware – These software combat all kinds of malware listed above and is the best go to package for security. For firms, people with real confidential data, definitely invest in this software to protect yourselves.</li>
            <li>Anti adware – Now there are some adverts that are genuine, trustable and actually informative however there are those other few who tend to creep into your browser and opens random links, or asks to open a weird link. These are the links you should beware of and never open. When in doubt of such links, simply close the browser. Don’t try explore these at the cost of your computer and its content. Definitely not worth it. If possible, download an ad-block extension to your browser and this should save you from the fabricated adverts that are out there.</li>
            <li>Fake files download – In addition to the fake adverts, definitely do not download any unknown source of files, foreign files or any such files that you are not aware of.
            <li>Use secured e-commerce sites for purchase – you really don’t want to be sending out your card details to a foreign, unknown, dodgy website and allow that fake website to gain access to your card and exploit these confidential details to their advantage. Always ensure the website you’re entering your card details in are trustworthy, protected and secure.</li>
            <li>WiFi connection – We see many random free public WiFi connections available and blindly connect to them. Don’t! Only if you know it is trustworthy then go for it, otherwise do not connect to random public WiFi networks.</li>
            <li>Read website privacy policies – Sometimes the effort of reading these policies can come a long way. Especially when in doubt of the website and need that re-assurance, do read the policy to verify if it’s a safe website or not then proceed.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, BACK UP your data.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p style = "font-size: 16px;">These are the basic good computing security measures YOU as the user should undergo in order to play your part at safeguarding your information and computer.</p>
