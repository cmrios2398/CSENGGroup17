It is a study of mathematical techniques for secure communication, which is using “hidden writing” to keep information secret. Using a simple example, we decide a set of secret code between us and no other people know how it works, and the secret code is the ‘key’. Then I encrypt the massage and pass to you. You can easily use the ‘key’ to decrypt the message, but other people are not able to know the original message. </p>

                      <p style = "font-size: 16px;">About 4000 years ago, a number of unusual symbols were written on the tomb of nobleman KHNUMHOTEP II. It is known as the oldest text contained a modification of the text, which is one of cryptography’s components.</p>
                      <p style="font-size:16px;">In 1900BC, the first known use of cryptography appeared in Egypt. It was found carved into the wall of a tomb from the Old Kingdom of Egypt circa.</p>
                      <p style="font-size:16px;">In 5th century BC, a society called SPARTANS sent and received secret messages using a cylinder cryptographic device. The device, called a SCYTALE, was only owned by the sender and the recipient of the message. The message was written across a narrow strip and wound around the cylinder. Only a same size of SCYTALE was used to re-wound it then people can get the information written.</p>

Caesar was the first recorded person to use this kind of method. However, it is believed other substitution ciphers had been used before.</p>
                      <p style="font-size: 16px;"></p>In 1466, an essay written by an Italian LEON BATTISTA ALBERTI described building a cipher disk and founding the idea of POLY ALPHABETIC ciphers. However he did not develop his concept and left it to others. A French cryptographer BLAISE DE VIGENERE developed the the VIGENERE SQUARE based on a practical poly alphabetic system. At the time, it was believed the VIGENERE SQUARE was unbreakable. </p>

                  <p style="font-size: 16px">Nowadays public-key cryptography is widely used in many websites and organizations. This system uses pairs of keys named public keys (which can be disseminated widely) and private keys (which are only held by owners). Holders of public keys can do encryption using their keys. However, only the holder of private key can do decryption of any encrypted message. In a public-key signature system, a message and a private key can be combined to create a short digital signature on the message. Public keys holders can verify whether the signature was made by the owner of private key to check whether the message has been changed by someone else. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">This method is a substitution of original message’s letters to other form. Caesar Cipher is a typical substitution cipher. It shifts the letters of original message. If you want to try a Caesar cipher encryption, click <a href="http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/caesar-shift-cipher.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">However, in each language several letters have larger frequency to be used. Therefore an analysis of frequency can easily break this kind of ciphers.

                    <p>To understand how it works, there is an example of an encryption using the Vigenere Square.<br>
                      Suppose we want to encrypt “HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLD”.<br>
                      Now chose a world to be the “key”, for example “SECURITY”. Repeat it until the length matches the length of the massage to be encrypted, for example, ”SECURITYSECURITYSECU”.<br><br>
                      [ Row=key, Column=Message, match each letter. For example, first letter of message is H, we find column S and check H=Z. ]<br><br>
